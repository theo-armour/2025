*How Narrative Shapes Valuation*

## Copilot 100 Word Summary:

>Companies often command premium valuation multiples not because of superior fundamentals, but due to compelling narratives that shape investor belief. These stories—about visionary founders, cultural resonance, or technological inevitability—coordinate expectations and inflate price-to-earnings ratios. Historical examples like tulip mania, railroads, and dot-coms show how narrative drives valuation. Founders become archetypes, and companies aligned with the zeitgeist attract higher multiples. However, narrative premiums are fragile; when belief collapses, so do valuations. Investors face a dilemma: ignore the story and miss upside, or embrace it and risk losses. Ultimately, fundamentals set the floor, but narrative sets the ceiling.

## Two Comments

Thank you, Joan Westenberg for another compelling article. Reading this article spurred me to come up with a couple of takeaways that may help people-who-start-things act upon how to think about narrative and valuation.

## Founders are fundamental

>Narratives don’t replace fundamentals; they stretch and refract them.
>
>Think of it as two layers. Fundamentals set the floor. Narrative sets the ceiling. Between them = the market’s willingness to believe.

Perhaps you can also think of the narrative as being two layers. The founder's narrative is a fundamental narrative. This sets the floor.  The public's perception is the public narrative . This sets the ceiling. Between them = the market’s narrative.

Advice to founders: Be the fundamental narrative. Own it. Live it. Breathe it. Eat your own dog food. Be it. It helps if you can write it down.

## Readme files are the "Hello, World!" of the narrative

When you create a program in a place such as GitHub or GitLab, you do a few things:

1. You give the project a name
2. You tell it where to put it
3. You create a license
4. You create a readme file

The readme file is the "Hello, World!" of the narrative. It tells people what the project is about, how to use it, and why it matters. It sets the tone for the entire project and helps people understand its purpose.

Advice to founders: Write your readme file. Make it clear, concise, and compelling. Use it to tell your story and set the tone for your company.
