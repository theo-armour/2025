## What is Homespun Journalism?

A dream of mine: A repository of the stories of people. Bits and pieces of text written by normal people in the normal ways they write. A collection of thoughts of people reflecting upon about their lives.

From my experience, the writing will be short snippets of text under 500 words long. They will relate to past experiences, quite anecdotal. They will provide a glimpse into people's lives.

All the thoughts are kept on a repository on Github. From here they may be curated and published in various ways. They may be backed up to the Internet Archives.

## Characteristics of Homespun Journalism

* The writing is not held to the same standard as normal journalism.
* Writing may be anecdotal, personal, and informal, structure is rambling, unclear timelines and causality, weak transitions, subjective language, first-person assertions as facts, emotive or sensational phrasing, or even boring.

## Importance of Homespun Journalism

We know a lot about the thoughts of Thomas Jefferson. But we know little about the thoughts of Sally Hemings, Jefferson's concubine.

The thoughts of the famous are documented. The thoughts of normal people are forgotten.

Nonetheless the thoughts of normal people are important. They provide a glimpse into the lives of normal people.

## Publishing

From time to time some of the thoughts are put into newsletters for seniors and others. Occasionally thoughts are collected and published on the Internet using things like Medium or Substack. Perhaps some of the thoughts are collected and curated by editors and put into articles of greater depth.

The mission is not to gain a wider readership. The mission is to gain a wider writership.

## What is Written is Remembered

The vision is to help people remember the important aspects of their lives. By remembering they will help relive. In reliving they may not be retired, they may be rejuvenated. At the same time, they begin to recover the utility and agency that elders have provided in ages past: the wisdom of the ages passing on to the succeeding generations.

## Memories May Be Useful
The old people teaching the young people. Instead of passing away in front of the screen or book, elders are the ultimate influencers.

Even better, when its the elderly themselves banding together, forming groups, and teaching each other in order reestablish a position of respect and influence in society.
