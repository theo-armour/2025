Dear A

I'm writing to you because this seems more personal and more communicative or simpl human than saying, "dear diary". And in this day of AI, it's somehow a stronger thing to be writing to humans than to an AI bot.

So it looks like I've begun to commit myself to stopping publishing the Heritage Happenings newsletter.I've mentioned it to several people. The woman who's doing the calendar, will use _Heritage Happenings_ as the title for the calendar in the future, so the publication itself will not perish. And I will talk about this at Friday's Residence Council meeting.

But of course, this does not mean that I will stop working on things like this myself. So that is why I'm writing this article right now. And to help me get going, I'm addressing it to you, A!

Today's Magic
Usually when I think about my days, it doesn't seem as if that much happened. But then when I start actually writing down the notes of all the things that happened, wow, I've been productive. So one of the fun things was a genealogical app I came across today: if you're a member of Geni, you can type in your name and it will tell you all the famous people you're related to.

Education in the Age of AI
This is a big topic. The main thing is that students are using AI and teachers are using AI.And the AI is generating "slop". Educational systems are in the process of breaking.

A solution would be to have more teacher-pupil live interaction. But when a professor has 300 students, that's impossible.

So the first solution would be to train, create a digital replica of the professors who can then have multiple office hours with multiple students.

This would enable students to have discussions with simulations of their professors. And the professors would be able to monitor the discussions and grade them.
And of course, the professors would be able to have live office hours with students as well. But probably before too long, students could send their digital replicas to do the communication with the professor simulators.

When I think of problems like this, I often think of what programmers would do? So many of the tools we use today came about because programmers use them themselves, including online calendars, email, Databases and more. A current and very successful way of improving programming is called pair programming. This is when two computer programmers work with each other. Very often this means that one programmer is writing and the other one is commenting, and then after a period of time. the roles are reversed.

This makes me think that students might also benefit from this kind of activity. There could be pair learning environments where pairs of students work with each other. First one student prepares for and teaches a topic, and then the roles are reversed.

Taking up such a system would require a lot of designing and consideration and experimentation. For example, trying to find students of equal levels and equal skills is not easy. But it's likely to be much better than having machines talking to each other.

But an even more interesting way might be getting young people to interact with old people.Setting up Zoom sessions so that young people could teach old people.

And of course, this could also be done with people from a variety of countries talking to each other.

So that could work with students that were fairly interactive and outgoing. Less outgoing students could maybe make videos and share those videos with other less outgoing students and do it. It wouldn't have to be live.

This all assumes that there's something like Khan Academy where there are three-minute videos for everything. In other words, there are ways for students to pick up tiny aspects of their learning and being able to then share it with other students.
