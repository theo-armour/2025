# 2025-09-01 Homespun Writing


## What is Homespun Journalism?

Homespun writing refers to a style of prose or storytelling that is the way most people write in daily life. It is informal, personal, and often anecdotal. It may lack the polish and structure of professional writing, but it has a charm and authenticity that comes from its unfiltered nature.

## Vision

My dream is to capture, collect, and preserve homespun writing — the voices of ordinary people documenting their lives in their own words.

**What we're gathering:**

* **Personal narratives** — The everyday stories that people tell about their experiences, struggles, joys, and observations
* **Unfiltered expression** — Text written by regular people in the natural ways they communicate, without editorial polish or academic pretension
* **Reflective moments** — The thoughts and insights of ordinary individuals as they make sense of their lives, communities, and times

**Our approach:**

All collected writing is housed in an open-source repository on GitHub, creating a living archive of contemporary human experience. From this central collection, materials can be curated and published in various formats — digital collections, themed anthologies, or historical compilations.

**Our commitment:**

Every contribution is freely licensed for reuse, ensuring these voices remain accessible to researchers, writers, and future generations. Regular backups to the Internet Archive provide additional preservation, safeguarding these personal histories against digital loss.

**Why this matters:**

In an age of algorithmic feeds and corporate media, authentic human voices risk being lost. This project ensures that the real thoughts, experiences, and perspectives of everyday people are preserved — not as data points, but as the irreplaceable human stories they are.

We build a repository of human experience, one small voice at a time.


## Characteristics of Homespun Journalism

From my experience, the writings are short snippets of text under 500 words long. They relate to past or recent experiences, quite anecdotal. They provide a glimpses into people's lives.

The writing is not held to the same standard as normal journalism.

* Writing may be anecdotal, personal, and informal
* Structure may be rambling
* Unclear timelines and causality
* Weak transitions, subjective language
* First-person assertions as facts,
* Emotive or sensational phrasing
* Or even boring

And all of these writing issues that we abhor in normally published writing are acceptable, perhaps even welcome.

They give us authentic voices, uneutered by literary convention or editorial polish.

## Importance of Homespun Writing

We know a lot about the thoughts of Thomas Jefferson. But we know little about the thoughts of Sally Hemings, Jefferson's concubine. The thoughts of the famous are documented. The thoughts of normal people are forgotten.

Nonetheless the thoughts of normal people are important. Homespun writing makes literature accessible to ordinary people, both as readers and writers. When writing doesn't require formal education or elite vocabulary, more people feel empowered to document their experience and share their stories.

## What is Written is Remembered

The vision is to help people remember the important aspects of their lives. By remembering they will help relive. In reliving they may not be retired, they may be rejuvenated. At the same time, they begin to recover the utility and agency that elders have provided in ages past: the wisdom of the ages passing on to the succeeding generations.

## Memories May Be Useful

The old people teaching the young people. Instead of passing away in front of the screen or book, elders are the ultimate influencers.

Even better, when its the elderly themselves banding together, forming groups, and teaching each other in order reestablish a position of respect and influence in society.

## Publishing

My ambition is from time to time collect the writings of friends and neighbors and publish snippets of them here on this blog.

Longer term some of the thoughts are put into newsletters for seniors and others. Occasionally thoughts are collected and published on the Internet using things like Medium or Substack. Perhaps some of the thoughts are collected and curated by editors and put into articles of greater depth.

The mission is not to gain a wider readership. The mission is to gain a wider "writership".



So, what's on your mind? ;-)
