# Business Planning in the Age of AI

The experience of the past five days has been very interesting and enjoyable. I have been able to double-click deep into Drew's current pitch deck as well as trying to get to a view from 30,000 feet. 

I don't know what comes next, but I'm now prepared to do at least three things:

Let's say Drew wanted to present the pitch deck that he has now to some investors next week. Having started the Writing for Today" post. I could certainly help make the minor editorial changes that would clarify and strengthen his efforts. 

Or if the time frame is further out, we could perhaps discuss the three questions in the "Project Analysis" post.

* Are these the right players for the project?
* Is this a viable project?
* Are the audience and the project "pitch" aligned? 

And thirdly — especially in the age of AI — can we hypothesize that could change the rules of the game we are playing.

I'm not saying that here that the "Creating the Checklist" post is a game changer, but it is "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants"

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants

It builds on traditional tools:

* Create and use a checklist
* Identify measurable targets and metrics
* Standardize the data capture and and analysis

The next pass might enable some "Aha!" moments. For example:

* Could we use AI to build a Quickbooks module that could be handed over to prospects that assembles much of the data semi-automatically
* Could we scrape data off the web that identifies competition, regulation issues and other technical hurdles?
* And can we drop Drew's entire pitch deck into AI and see what she says? ;-)

Nonetheless the could be other game-changing approaches to Draw's project. And all that will take further discussion. May hope is that these posts help raise the quality of the discussion and point is in direction that not only help complete our sentences but provoke our brains into coming up with the stuff that only human brains can conjure up: magic!

Drew over to you.
