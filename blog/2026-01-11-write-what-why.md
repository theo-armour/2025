# 2026-01-11 What about my writing?

## Why

* I write to explain things I care about.
* My writing is detailed.
* Authoritative.
* Written very simply.
* But covering many details.
* Includes links, footnotes, and asides.
* It is agentive. Useful.
* It tells you why it is important to me, and perhaps to you.
* It is not meant to be poetic or literary or flashy.
* It is meant to be clear, direct, and helpful.
* It is meant to be beautiful in its clarity and usefulness.
* It is meaningful because it is helpful, useful, and nice to the world.
* It is hedonic Because it explains, it mentions the senses and looks.
* It is eudaimonic because it connects to traditions, to history, to culture, to people, and to values.
* It is beautiful because of the way it looks and smells, and reminds and reflects.

>The relationship between truth and beauty has been a central tension in human thought for millennia. While they are distinct concepts—one cognitive (truth) and one aesthetic (beauty)—thinkers from Plato to modern physicists have often argued they are fundamentally intertwined.
