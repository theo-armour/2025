* But covering many details.
* Includes links, footnotes, and asides.
* It is agentive. Useful.
* It tells you why it is important to me, and perhaps to you.
* It is not meant to be poetic or literary or flashy.
* It is meant to be clear, direct, and helpful.
* It is meant to be beautiful in its clarity and usefulness.
* It is meaningful because it is helpful, useful, and nice to the world.
* It is hedonic Because it explains, it mentions the senses and looks.
* It is eudaimonic because it connects to traditions, to history, to culture, to people, and to values.
* It is beautiful because of the way it looks and smells, and reminds and reflects.
* my writing: It's to be about taking some unimportant little thing and making it an important.Can I take an important thing in my life?Oops! Can I take one of my favorite things and write a story about how important it is?
