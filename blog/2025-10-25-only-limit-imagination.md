# Only limit: Imagination

One of my favorite Medium/Substack authors is Joan Westenberg.

See:

She may be overtaking my favorite feel-good blogger, Thomas Oppong

And she may be overtaking may current favorite Book author, Agnes Callard.

Now, I wonder why I use the word "overtaking." This term seems competitive and therefore not politically correct. I think I'm using it because it's probably the amount of minutes per month that I'm devoting to something In other words, what am I consuming, skimming, er,reading Faster Miles Per Hour.

Anyway, this article Joan published the other day really set my brain going:

"You Are Insignificant. That’s a Good Thing."

* A Short Guide to Being Infinitesimally Small
* https://medium.com/westenberg/you-are-insignificant-thats-a-good-thing-c7114a296386

You are nothing, you are insignificant. Everything you do will be forgotten.

Therefore, you have no need to worry. There's no pressure. You can be whatever you want! Whatever you do is okay!

She says:

"And that's a good thing because it means we can stop trying so hard to be significant and just focus on being alive right now, in this improbable moment we've been given."

Everything she says rings absolutely true! She makes total sense. There is nothing to fault in her logic or her words.

And all of this drives me insanely bonkers!

Because to me.There are just things like the words of T.S. Eliot: "There is only the trying; the rest is none of your business".

So I find articles like this totally depressing, but thankfully I read some of the comments.

And then I got to the comment of Martin James Millen.

>Thanks for a beautiful account of our insignificance in the material universe - with which I agree entirely.
However, just to give a balancing perspective we actually have a foot in two realities - the reality of matter and the reality of mind.
>
>When it comes to the reality of mind, it is the universe that is insignificant and we humans that are infinite.
>
>After all, no galaxy, star, planet, mountain, rock, grain of sand, molecule or atom has ever had a single thought or ever had a single feeling.
>
>In one reality we are infinitesimal while the universe if infinite but in the other we are infinite and the universe is infinitesimal...

Thank you, Martin James Millen!

Your good words allowed me to scuttle back to my happy place.

There, I am reminded of the corporate motto used in the late 80s by of my former employer, Autodesk To describe the uses to which you could put their product AutoCAD, a computer-aided design system I helped design:

"The only limit is your imagination."

In any case, yes, both propositions are true and factual.

And I'm saying this with particular reference to Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's book Through the Looking-Glass, where he famously tells Alice, "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less".

Thus:

I am totally insignificant. And I am totally significant.

And I must admit that this feeling is very important to me.


I am reaching the end of my life. It is not really logical to plan for anything more than three to five years from now. I am a designer. I've always been a designer. I will always be a designer. So, what do I design now?

It must be something like my legacy. What do I leave behind?What lives on? What matters?

So, of course, I will "melt, thaw and resolve into a dew". There will be nothing left.

And at the same time, my imagination will live forever!

;-)

And it's OK for me to feel this way, because of the multiverse theory.

>If time and space are infinite, then infinite realities are a mathematical and physical inevitability, a concept rooted in several prominent theories. The principle is simple: with infinite resources (space and time) and a finite number of ways for particles to arrange themselves, **every possible outcome must happen somewhere and an infinite number of times**.

***

>**The Quilted (Level I) Multiverse**
>
>This model is the most direct consequence of an infinite universe.
>
>**Theory:** If our universe is spatially infinite and matter is distributed uniformly on a large scale, then every possible arrangement of particles must repeat an infinite number of times.
>**Infinite realities:** This would mean that somewhere far beyond our observable universe, there exists another region of space—a "Hubble volume"—that is a perfect replica of our own. In these realities, a copy of you is living an identical life, while others exist where events happened slightly or dramatically differently.

Nonetheless, the intention to design a legacy or "some life after death" thing remains a curious and challenging pass time.

Or putting it another way

>The famous Jefferson quote about lighting a candle is, "He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lites his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me". Jefferson used this analogy to explain how sharing knowledge and ideas is a process that benefits both the giver and the receiver.

What can I possibly do that would help light a candle in another generation?
