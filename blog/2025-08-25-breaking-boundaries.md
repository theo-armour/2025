# 2025-08-25 Breaking the Boundaries Between Artifact and Admirer

Below are links to some recent discussions about fans interacting with performers.

About 10 years ago, I wrote an article in a similar vein titled "The Audience Talks Back." (I'll try and find a copy.)

At some future time, with the benefit of artificial intelligence,fans will talk and engage with books, paintings and other artistic artifacts in a way that is more interactive and engaging than simply viewing or reading them. In other words, these objects begin to "come to life" and interact with their admirers. Or perhaps the admirers will be able to "step into" the world of the artifact and experience it in a more immersive way. Or perhaps the artifact will be able to "talk back" to the admirer, answering questions and providing insights. Or perhaps the admirer will be able to "remix" the artifact, creating new versions or interpretations of it. And groups of admirers will be able to interact with each other and with the artifact in a shared virtual space.
