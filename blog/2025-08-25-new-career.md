# 2025-08-25 New Career

I think it's time to change careers. Publishing the heritage happenings is just too much. I'm not a bad writer, so instead of publishing, I should go to becoming an author of articles.I could publish them on my blog on TheoArmour.com and then upload them to Medium and Substack.

As much as possible, the writing will be human.

I will write about aging, technology and society.

From my experience, if I've given a little lead, I can write about almost anything.
So what I will do is come up with a series of phrases or ideas that I can write about.
Another thing is that maybe there will be different topics every month. Building up on what we never really did well with the paper heritage happenings, set 12 different health topics, one for each month, and each month, at least once, I write about the topic at hand.
I could even do the country of the month and take other people's writing and publish it on my blog, noting that I gathered the story and I've edited it and I'm adding some meaning and so on and so forth, embellishing the story, publishing other people's work.
So one thing I could be writing about is my publishing efforts. For example, trying to get Next Village and Heritage in touch with each other, trying to start writing groups and all my little efforts. I could be writing about these and their failures and their joys and whatever.
Of course, I can talk about my bar hopping and the way I interact with people. And that's going to be a big part of it, how we get people out from their devices and talking to each other.
And I could talk about my plans and projects. So, for example, talking about getting outside help for residents. For example, as I get older and more aged, I hope that I can hire companions that would come and help me take a walk around the block and talk to me about the news and keep me informed and up to date, and in doing so, reduce the speed of my dementia.
And I could write about my daughters and their plans and their projects and how we relate and communicate with each other, even though we live in very different places. And adding into all of that how I've given them their freedom, and I hope that they're helping them using it to the maximum.
And then a big thing to write about is my ways of archiving everything that I have and creating my own afterlife.
And I could even write about my family and everything that I know about my ancestors.
And I think this begins to help me define why this is a priority. I've got to get this going before my brain goes. The archiving is half of it, but the other half is all the knowledge that's still in my brain has not been written down.
And so there we are, over 500 words in just a few minutes. Easy peasy. Just me talking into the computer and pressing the voice to text button. This is marvelous.

Wait, there's more.

So I should just start writing and talking and perhaps not even editing. This would prove that this is human writing. Well, I obviously can't prove because AI could do whatever I'm doing, I'm sure. But it's an indication. It would be an indication that whatever I'm saying and writing is coming from me, Theo, as the human.

And that came up because I think I should come up with my different seed phrases, little thoughts that can develop into a story. And of course, the first one is, how do I show that I'm human?

And then more than that, I will learn how to dictate stories more correctly and in better ways. Or maybe not. I may learn to dictate stories in crazier ways, but in any case, I'm dictating and the story's coming out, and it's coming out from a human.

And even more.

I seem to be liking writing messages to individual people. It's like writing letters to people. Maybe I should continue with this idea, and every post starts with a dear <name>. And so then the name could indicate some kind of target that if I write person A, it's about AI. If I write to person B, it's about family. And if I write to person C, it's about architecture. Something like that. Maybe

So I'm just sitting here with my glass of wine, having a high old time, coming up with thoughts, and then getting them written down, by voice to text then recorded for posterity by being uploaded to GitHub.

Oh dang, that means that this text is AI processed, of course. This is not completely human text. It's me and AI together.Well, that's the future, so let's sit back and enjoy it, today

And now I've just written two emails to the people I usually write, A and G.

Oh, maybe I should just use their initials so nobody knows who they are except for me.

And they will know who they are anyway, so it makes no difference.
