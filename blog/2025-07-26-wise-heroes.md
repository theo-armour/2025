# 2025-07-26 Wise Heroes


## Preface ~ written a day later ~ 2025-07-27

Reviewing yesterday's writing just below. It is one of my favorite kinds of writing. It is when I consider a future in a kind of perfect utopian way. It's about a vision.

And, I could spend days double-clicking into all of the details and having even more fun.

But, reality beckons. See today's post for a different vision.

## What is a Wise Hero?

A wise hero is somebody, probably in their 50s to 70s, who has accumulated wisdom, wealth, and agency.

They are active, engaged, and generous.

They got to the top, overcame barriers, engaged in struggles. They made efforts that may be considered heroic.

They are living examples of a virtuous life. or at least they or somebody thinks so. ;-)

## Wealth Enables the Bootstrapping, Kickstarting

Eventually, being remembered should be something anybody can enjoy.

But as is often the case, it's people with spare capital that can jumpstart things.

## The need for preservation

Society has two ways of learning about people.

The biography and the novel (historically, poems and plays).

The biographies cover very exceptional people. Perhaps half of them were evil.

Fiction is unreality.

As the world enters a world of large language models, None of these efforts really help understand: what is an ordinary person like?

## The life of an ordinary person.

With the birth of the internet came the birth of a memory of lives. We now have billions of people's tweets, Instagram posts, email messages, playlists, and more.

As AI progresses, these could be used to create many aspects of the human the content belongs to.

The crucial but missing element would be their observations and motivations and self-critiques.

If the AI of the future is to be moral and ethical, and good, then it must understand these aspects of humanity.

## What is the biography of the future?

It is a recreation of a person at several stages, perhaps many, stages of their life.

You can talk to a youngster climbing a tree in the backyard with a family.

You can converse a freshman in their dorm room a week into her freshman year of college.

You can hear the foreman talking to fellow workers on the shop floor.

You can have office hours with the professor in their lab.

And all of these are the same person.

With each dialogue, there music of the era, some aspect of the local news of that location, all set in a 3D virtual world

At the same time, there is no problem in inviting Karl Marx, the Dalai Lama, and Donald Trump to come on the walk with you and hear their observations.

At the same time, there might be an altered reality. What would happen if If there were five siblings instead of none, or if Japan had won the war.

Or perhaps sliding the depiction of the events along a time scale, either backwards or forwards in time.

or as Perplexity Comet suggest

>When analyzing a historical text, one can apply political social, economic, cultural, religious or philosophical, gender, rhetorical or literary, authorial intent, audience reception, comparative or historical context, ethical or moral, and source criticism filters for a comprehensive interpretation.

## The Right to be Remembered

As and when the world becomes even more prosperous, certain things will become rights, including housing and healthcare and education.

Eventually, there may well be a right to be remembered. A guaranteed afterlife That a person may choose to acquire or not to not to acquire.

The right to be remembered is a complex topic in its own right. It could be covered in more detail elsewhere.

But that reality of that vision is far in the future.

In the more immediate future perhaps individuals are selected or voted on to be remembered by governments, organizations or family associations. But even that idea will take considerable time to gestate.

## Where Do We Start?

If it appears that digital replicas will eventually proved virtuous benefits to society but do not yet exist with the desired functionality we may want to consider:

Where do we start?

* What are the required deliverables?
* what methodology is going to fund the process?
* Who are the guinea pigs?

## Wise Replicas Sources

The first wise replicas are are likely to be created For humans that have an extensive collection of personal data. They are likely to have been some kind of data hoarder.

The data that is provided to the replica creators might include the following:

* House and possession insurance appraisals.
* Photograph albums, filing cabinets
* Emails, folders, and files
* Social networks
* Media articles
* Address books
* Yearbooks
* Calendars
* Playlists, Amazon purchases
* Accounts, portfolios, statements and assets

## Conditions

* Virtually all of the above efforts are carried out by team members
* The original does little of none of the above effort
* When the original participates, it is to annotate, remark, make observations upon what has been recorded already.
* The original adds insight, nuance, corrections
* The process is highly cognizant of the various methods of available historiography

## Wide Range of Replica Deliverables

* Daily time line with location, activity and related media
* Replicas that morphs to replicate vocabulary, abilities, attitude at any age.
* The ability to recreate a 3D landscape of the location at any point in the time line.
* The ability to recreate the events and culture defining aspects of any point on the time line.
* The ability for the replica to interact with other replicas and NPCs.
* The ability to create challenges or games at any point in the timeline.
* The ability for the replica to interact with the environment into which it's currently appearing.
* The ability to edit, improve, change or tweak the replica, Perhaps similar to the director in the movie.
* The ability for the replica to improve its resemblance to the original over a period of time.

## 2025-07-27 ~ Annotation

The following text was written after a long, beautiful, nice dinner with Caltech alumni.

It's just rough, preliminary notes.

Some of the aspects here are discussed in the 2025-07-27 post

## Toolkit

Unfortunately, self-replicates don't self-replicate.

* People doing the scanning
* People doing the labeling and tagging

{2025-07-27: There is perhaps nothing more important than this section. It would be about the processes, methods, and guidelines in developing the toolkit to help people create digital replicas.}

## Where do we start: Finding the players

Stage left: Enter wise hero.

gumption, wherewithal and pride

Early adopters, who and where are you?

In the initial stages the funding, the wisdom and the original are one and the same person: an individual with cash, the smarts and the drive. Yes, our wise hero.

In other words we know the type of person we are looking for.

The issue is that the wise hero knows nothing about us, what we want to do, or has any inclination at all about any of this.

If we want something to happen, we have to go and find that person, educate them, and get them to sign the check.

## Looking for Mr Right

In many aspects of like there are talent scouts. Baseball, football and professional sports have scouts

Movie produces use talent agencies. Book publishers task to literary agents. And so on.

## Who and where are the talent scouts for wise heroes?

You are unlikely to acquire a wise hero through a mass marketing campaign.

Wise heroes are acquired by engaged, personal contact.

The following sections explore the process of acquiring talent scouts for the business of acquiring wise heroes.


## One Percenters

The number of households with more than $13 million dollars seems to be around 1.3 million households.

The population of individuals worth at least US$100 million climbed 4.2%, surpassing the 100,000 mark for the first time.

I have no idea how much of that money is inherited, or family money, and how much was created by living wise heroes.

This is not an insignificant number, but it's definitely not a mass market.

## One Percenter Talent Scouts

* Family offices: associations
* Luxury websites: planting stories
* Philanthropy: Wealthy people Not necessarily wise heroes themselves paying for the replicas of wise heroes they admire choice.

## Secondary Talent Scouts

Professionals who serve the wealthy and can identify wise heroes.

## Biographers

## Genealogists

## Family historians

Ancestry.com

## Libraries
