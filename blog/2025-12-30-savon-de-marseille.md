Theo Armour Savon de Marseille Economist Magazine letter

It's time to retire my bar of soap. After many years of faithful service, my trusty bar of _Savon de Marseille_ has finally worn down to a nub. This soap, made in the traditional way in the south of France[1], has been my go-to soap bar for hand washing for over three years.

My fascination for soap in generalgoes back to my early childhood.[2] My fascination for Savon de Marseille certainly goes back to the mid-1970s. On May 29, 1976, The Economist magazine published an article on the Business Brief, "The Beauty Business." The article reported that the French consumed significantly less soap and deodorant than their neighbors—roughly half the amount of soap per capita compared to the British.

The article generated several humorous letters to the editor, including that that's why the French consume more perfume than the British or that they use more B-days than baths. And there happened to be a letter from a reader named Theo Armour from London[3]. He wrote that the French's lower soap consumption was due to their preference for traditional soap bars like Savon de Marseille, which last longer and are more economical than liquid soaps or deodorants. BTW, I am forever grateful and honored to have been published in The Economist magazine!

Where I cannot remember is where this specific knowledge of the durability of Savon de Marseille came from. This was well before my marriage to Isabelle, and I had not had many contacts with life in France up to that point in my life in England. But I did have several visits to the South of France to visit my father and step-mother.In St. Paul-de-Vence, and attend my sister Allison's wedding there. I assume it must be during that time when I gained this hugely valuable piece of life advice.

Nonetheless, the durability was confirmed after then wife-to-be Isabelle and I met, and I went to her family's farm in northern France. In the wash basin outside the ground toilet on the ground floor. there was always a large bar of Savon de Marseille for hand washing. It was there in 1981 it was there in 1991, even with frequent use by the entire family and guests. You had to rub and rub to get anything out of it, but nonetheless your hands came out squeaky clean, wash after wash.

More recently after years of relying og soap coming out of a bottle, I felt the call to return to my roots and try Savon de Marseille again. Isabelle kindly bought me a bar of the real thing from a shop in Paris.

The soap in the photo above was given to me by Isabelle several years ago as a Christmas present. I started using it perhaps in 2022.

As you can see, it is still quite large. You can still discern the "72%" stamp on the soap and the color is still definitely green. These two signs are the classic evidence that the soap is genuine, made from genuine olive oil. The issue is that after three years its composition has been altered, and it now feels now almost like a block of wax. With use, the olive oil has been soaked out.

Well, it turns out that there are techniques to the successful usage of Savon de Marseille. If you use Savon de Marseille just like any other soap, then you wash your hands and just put it on the side of the wash basin. The bottom stays wet. And the wet soap melts away almost instantly into a puddle of mush. Not good.

The trick is to let the soap dry out extremely well in between washes. It must not sit in a wet soap dish. It must be elevated so that air gets around all its surfaces. So, in a sense, water is the enemy of a Savon de Marseille. The sooner it gets the dirt off your fingers and it goes back to being warm and dry, the happier it is! [4]

As you can see, I eventually purchased a plastic soap saver where the soap is sitting on raised plastic prongs. This helps. The other thing that I do is to alternate which side is facing up when I put the bar back on the soap saver.

The original gift from Isabelle contained three bars of soap. As you can see, I will now start using bar number two. With my lessons learned from the first bar, I assume that the second bar will last a lifetime (mine) and I will be able to leave the third bar as part of my legacy.[5]

[1] When we lived in Paris in the early 50s, my sister, my nanny, and I would listen to a radio program titled "La Famille Duraton" (but I always think of it as "La Famille du Raton (The Raccoon Family)). "La Famille Duraton" was heavily sponsored by Palmolive soap, and the ads were often read or performed by the show's producer and actor, Jean-Jacques Vital. If I remember correctly, even though we were some of the most safe kind of family from time to time, we would have a bar of the green palmolive for our baths. But they never lasted very long.

[2] Savon de Marseille is traditionally made from vegetable oils, primarily olive oil, and is known for its gentle cleansing properties. It has been produced in the Marseille region of France for over 600 years and is often associated with natural and eco-friendly skincare.

[3] While I can find the article, I cannot find the letters to the editors section because they apparently have not been digitized yet. So, I will need to go to a library that has paper copies or reprints of The Economist in the 1970s In order to find a copy of my letter.

[5] There may be another side to all of this.The bar of soap at Isabelle's family's house was white.It was the Savon de Marseille made with palm oil, not olive oil.Also, it was shaped like an olive or an American football.This may mean that it any water slid off of it much more easily than from the flat tops and bottoms of the olice oil=based soap bars.

[4] The downside to this durability, is that it is not likely that I will ever be able to test the durability of another soap that I have developed unfulfilled craving for, which is soap from Aleppo in Syria. I believe I learned about the Aleppo soap, when I was reading about Agatha Christie's furtive trip to Aleppo in the 1930s.
