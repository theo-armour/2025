# 2025-07-27 Heroic Pivot

## Preface

Looking back on what I wrote yesterday, there's nothing that I could say is wrong about it. But that does not mean that it cannot fail. You can be completely right and nonetheless fail.

Just below are some observations on yesterday's writing, followed by some possible pivots.

## 1. Original Data Access

### The Problem

Every item of food that I have eaten at a restaurant, every shirt that I have bought, every appointment I ever made It's been an online transaction somewhere. Very likely, at some future time, comprehensive and detailed data on every aspect of an individual's life may be be accessible. "It's all written in the big book somewhere." will become an available reality. (The map becomes bigger than the territory, But that's another story ;-)

Nonetheless, in this current era of paranoia, surveillance, and more paranoia, the hope of finding somebody who will release even small amounts of personal data about themselves personally, besides me, is rather unlikely. And/or, it will take a difficult or highly clever (future) search process.

Note to self: Do a search on rich, garrulous, quantified-self people.

### Pivot Solution: Start small ~ Limit Focus

While, the possibility of creating whole person replica remains a distant dream, giving up the entire vision seems a shame.

Is it not possible consider a smaller vision? even if we cannot create full mind-body replicas, might it not be possible to create little replic-ettes?

These could be replicas that just focus in on a particular aspect in somebody's life. Instead of concentrating on a whole person, it would just be a sharp focus on a hobby, a passion, or some personal effort.

Interestingly, I have personal experience with capturing glimpses of people lives.

In the 1990s I built websites for artists and creatives. I did this for no charge. My dream was to see what creative people could do with the possibility of building creative websites. Unfortunately, it turned more into things like helping people remember their password and I gave up on the idea.

Nonetheless, from time to time, when I come across a body of creative work, I obtain access to the work from the creator.  capture it and get it on the internet, on GitHub — were it is likely to be available for a very, very long time. Some examples.

When my cousin Diana was in her thirties she worked as a model maker building physical mock-ups for interference checking of pipework and Nuclear Power Stations. The models were quite extraordinary creations. I built a website for her which we called: The Art of Power.

My fellow resident in my old people's home cannot stop talking about duck hunting. It turned out that he had spent 20 years writing down stories about his duck tales. He shared them with me, and here they are:

A decade or so ago, I ended up talking to a man at Cafe Zoetrope off on Columbus Avenue a number of times, and we got to be sort of friends. It turns out that he liked to write a poem a day. He shared some of them a day with me. I scanned them and put them here:

* https://tony-dingman.github.io/

Here are even more snippets of people's lives: https://github.com/evereverland/2019/tree/master/everlandings

{It looks like there are quite a few broken links and bits that could be fixed up, but each one is real and contains data.}

So the idea is to focus in on a single aspect of somebody's life and build a replica gist of those moments and time and place.

For example, I Have scanned a cookbook written by a fellow resident. Having been married to a lawyer, she's worried about copyright because she obtained recipes from her friends, So I'm not allowed to publish them.

But in another world, I could see taking her recipes, photographs of her, images of her kitchen, recordings of her voice, and building a replica of Anne in her kitchen talking and demonstrating her recipes using replicas of her pots and pans in a mock-up of her kitchen.

When I think of old people who love to do embroidery or gardening, or skiing, or whatever, I can think of ways of making replicas of just acting out those special moments and responding to your inquiries in real-time.

Looking forward, it might be possible to get people who are good at interviewing on special topics. For example, someone might be very good at helping people who are knitters create their knitting replic-ettes

Another specialist might be somebody who can talk to artists about their paintings and turn that into a discussion between you and the painter.

In other words, instead of concentrating on the full replica, let's just do one or two parts of an original. Let us take all the homilies a priest has saved, and turn that into some kind of live discussion.


## 2. Team Player ~ "Talent Scout"

### Problem (or an observation really) It's not SEO

The usual guidance is if you want customers, it's all about Church Engine Optimization (SEO) and sending money to Google.

### Solution: It's one-on-One ASAP

The kinds of things to be looked for here are the opposite of a mass market at this stage. On the contrary, it is all about sourcing just a few talented, motivated early adopters.

The goal is not finding the originals who mho might desire a replica. The goal is about onboarding individuals who will initiate the sourcing, guiding and implementing the process of originals being replicated.

For virtually every industry group, there is an association, publications, forums, and many other collective activities.

Within seconds, you can get pages of lists of people in that group on LinkedIn. Trade associations for that group. and their journals and publications.

This indicates that you can direct message almost anybody with expert domain knowledge.

In other words, the "talent scouts" I talked are talked about are readily. for example. look at the search results foer "family historian" on Linked In:

https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=family%20historian

An ambitious individual — with a targeted and engaging proposal — could be in direct contact with dozens of prospective "talent scouts"  with a day or two of effort and minimal expense.

## 3. What do early adopters want?


### Problem: It's not about a pitch deck.

Earlier adopters are not about looking at PowerPoints. They are users, so you need to give them something to use. Hurry, the doctors need to bang on the prototype. They need something to play with so they can tell you what they really need.

### Solution: It's about the prototype

I need to think about this.

Some considerations

* Identify talent who Have deep domain knowledge in different activities: Tap dancing, car racing, aquariums, whatever
* Build detailed game plan (vibe coded) for each
* Typical questions, documents, equipment
* Team players: videographers, documentalists, coaches
* Zoom, Meet (remote) as much as possible
