# Blog Read Me

I have posted all over the place. But then it dawned on me, why not post under my own name? Where I mostly hang out on GitHub.

So here I am.

The first set of posts in May of 2025 were part of an email dialog with my friend Drew.

The July posts are email threads to my friends Karen and Dan.
