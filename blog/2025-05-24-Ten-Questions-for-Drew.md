# Ten Questions for Drew

_There is an important update to this post at the end of the post._


## Intro

In response to the previous post, this was the start of a number of questions that Drew could ask his prospects in order to help evaluate whether they will be successful or not. 

Perhaps the more useful opportunity for a system like this would be to help prospects self-select. In other words, a prospect could be given these questions. If they answer the questions successfully, they would know that they are a good prospect and should consider asking Drew for help and guidance.

## Ten Question ~ a Draft

1. **Sufficient Revenue**: Do you have a revenue that makes sense for the project? In order words greater than, say, $500K per month?
2. **Sufficient Staffing**: Do you have a number of employees that makes sense for the project? In order words greater than, say, 10?
3. **Financial Management**: Are your accounts and finances in order? In other words, do you have a bookkeeper, accountant and auditor?
4. **Statutory Compliance**: Are you registered as a business? In other words, do you have a business license? In San Francisco? Is the company registered with the Secretary of State? In California or Delaware
5. **Project Timeframe**: Do you have a timeframe for the project? In other words, do you have a deadline for the project? Is there a completion date that is realistic? Less than a  year or two?
6. **Budget**: Can you envisage a budget for the project? In other words, do you have a budget that is realistic? Less than $100K?
7. **Mission & Vision**: Might you have a mission and a vision for the legacy you might wish to create? For the future of your organization?
8. **Team with Skills**: Do you have a team that is capable of committing to the project? In other words, do you have a team that has the skills, experience and the time to deliver the project?

9. **Legal and Risk Management**: Do you have appropriate legal protections in place? (contracts, insurance, intellectual property considerations)
10. **Success Metrics and Evaluation**: How will you measure the success of this project? Do you have clear metrics and evaluation criteria?

Looking at your "Ten Questions for Drew" document, I can see you have 8 questions listed, but the title suggests there should be 10. Let me read the full document to see what's there and identify what might be missing.

Read ten-questions-for-drew.md, lines 0 to 1

Read ten-questions-for-drew.md, lines 1 to 10

Based on the document, you have 8 questions but the title indicates there should be 10. Here's what's missing:

Missing Questions: 2 more questions (questions 9 and 10)

Looking at the pattern and themes of your existing questions, which cover:

* Financial readiness (revenue, finances, budget, business registration)
* Organizational capacity (employees, team capability)
Project planning (timeframe, mission/vision)

Two logical additional questions that would complete the set of 10 might be:

* Legal and Risk Management: Do you have appropriate legal protections in place? (contracts, insurance, intellectual property considerations)
* Success Metrics and Evaluation: How will you measure the success of this project? Do you have clear metrics and evaluation criteria?

Thinking about these questions this morning.  Two things:

The questions have an old-timey feeling. I don't see anything about CRM or IT or web presence or even anything to do with AI. 

The other missing aspect is that the prospect may know nothing about what Drew is trying to accomplish, and he needs to provide a list with what the prospect needs to know before considering working with Drew. 

Bonus thought.

All of this brings up the idea that this should be in the format of a checklist or quiz â€” or even a game .

Fingers crossed: Today's post [AI:] will be the start of a new series of posts that will help Drew to create a checklist or quiz or game that will help prospects self-select.
