# 2025-09-01 Homespun Writing


## What is Homespun Journalism?

Homespun writing refers to a style of prose or storytelling that is the way most people write in daily life. It is informal, personal, and often anecdotal. It may lack the polish and structure of professional writing, but it has a charm and authenticity that comes from its unfiltered nature.

## Vision

A dream of mine is to capture, collect and keep homespun writing:

* Repositories of the stories of people.
* Bits and pieces of text written by normal people in the normal ways they write.
* Collections of thoughts of ordinary people reflecting upon about their lives.

All the thoughts are kept on a repository on Github. From here they may be curated and published in various ways. They are open source and licensed to be freely reused. They may be backed up to the Internet Archives.


## Characteristics of Homespun Journalism

From my experience, the writings are short snippets of text under 500 words long. They relate to past or recent experiences, quite anecdotal. They provide a glimpses into people's lives.

The writing is not held to the same standard as normal journalism.

* Writing may be anecdotal, personal, and informal
* Structure may be rambling
* Unclear timelines and causality
* Weak transitions, subjective language
* First-person assertions as facts,
* Emotive or sensational phrasing
* Or even boring

And all of these writing issues that we abhor in normally published writing are acceptable, perhaps even welcome.

They give us authentic voices, unfiltered by literary convention or editorial polish.

## Importance of Homespun Writing

We know a lot about the thoughts of Thomas Jefferson. But we know little about the thoughts of Sally Hemings, Jefferson's concubine. The thoughts of the famous are documented. The thoughts of normal people are forgotten.

Nonetheless the thoughts of normal people are important. Homespun writing makes literature accessible to ordinary people, both as readers and writers. When writing doesn't require formal education or elite vocabulary, more people feel empowered to document their experience and share their stories.

## What is Written is Remembered

The vision is to help people remember the important aspects of their lives. By remembering they will help relive. In reliving they may not be retired, they may be rejuvenated. At the same time, they begin to recover the utility and agency that elders have provided in ages past: the wisdom of the ages passing on to the succeeding generations.

## Memories May Be Useful

The old people teaching the young people. Instead of passing away in front of the screen or book, elders are the ultimate influencers.

Even better, when its the elderly themselves banding together, forming groups, and teaching each other in order reestablish a position of respect and influence in society.

## Publishing

My ambition is from time to time collect the writings of my friends and neighbors and publish snippets of them here on my blog. Perhaps

Longer term some of the thoughts are put into newsletters for seniors and others. Occasionally thoughts are collected and published on the Internet using things like Medium or Substack. Perhaps some of the thoughts are collected and curated by editors and put into articles of greater depth.

The mission is not to gain a wider readership. The mission is to gain a wider "writership".
