## Preface

My daughter Cynthia said she enjoyed this book. So, I read it. As I tend to do when I read a book these days, I took a bunch of notes.

Given that today is my daughter Cynthia's birthday, I thought I might share these thoughts with her. And then, I thought, why not share them with you?

From sci-fi visionary and acclaimed author Annalee Newitz comes Automatic Noodle, a cozy near-future novella about a crew of abandoned food service bots opening their very own restaurant.
>
>While San Francisco rebuilds from the chaos of war, a group of food service bots in an abandoned ghost kitchen take over their own delivery app account. They rebrand as a neighborhood lunch spot and start producing some of the tastiest hand-pulled noodles in the city. But there’s just one problem. Someone―or something―is review bombing the restaurant’s feedback page with fake “bad service” reports. Can the bots find the culprit before their ratings plummet and destroy everything they created?

>Why is this website like this?
>
>robots in the 2060s have decided it’s cool to make retro 1990s “home page” websites, as a campy celebration of weird human aesthetics in early computer technology. the bots who run the restaurant in automatic noodle created this website.
>
>they think it’s cringe but also super cute. plus, It’s fun to play with old fashioned HTML, and see how humans imagined good interfaces back then.

## Observations / Identifiable Memes and Tropes

It's been a while since I read a full science fiction book — a really long time since I read Asimov' robot series. So I'm not really familiar with current android and robot fiction.

## Thoughts
* So many memes!
* Not much meaning, not much pleasure, but psychologically rich.
* Happy stuff
* Nice fun read!

## Questions

* Finding meaning: When you have a book that's written at a simple reading level , it's so easy just to skim! So maybe if you're trying to make a real point, you have to have a long one-sentence paragraph or a complicated text or something. But this book doesn't have that, so it's difficult to find the pithy sentences because they don't stand out.
* Meaningful comparisons. There is kind of an idea of the meaningless of a robotic life. But then that maybe just mirrors the meaning of a human life.
* Me/They: We try and find fun ~ beyond the meaning of life. They: The bots are trying to find meaning. Even if they can't own homes and make babies. They find meaning in going deeper, community and physical activity.
* Arbitrary cherry-picking: If you're writing about science fiction or magic, you cherry-pick some aspects to dwell on and ignore others. Here, for example, robots may have feelings, but no digestive system. They can feel pain in some ways, but not in all ways humans can. Delivery trucks still need humans In the front seat. The reader must accept this: it's impossible to explain everything all at once in one book.
* Let there be mysteries: Many mentions about a split between California and Yankee land And other dystopian events. But no explanations. Just accept the mystery as a given.
* Screenplay: yes, this book Could be used as the basis for a screenplay.A good number of screenshots described. Dialogue direct and easy to listen to.
* Series or sequels: It may not be easy to do sequels where the whole theme changes, but it might be easy to make something like a Friends or Cheers or Seinfeld.
