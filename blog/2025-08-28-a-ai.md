Gameducation

People become addicted to computer games. How can we harness these habits for learning, for education?

Young people are are labeled as ADHD. Give that same youngster a computer game that requires focus, planning, and execution. Six non-stop hours later they emerge, victorious, having learned a lot of skills, sensed the capabilities of team members, recovered from errors and more along the way.

Game engines are how AI was born. Will games be how AI will evolve into predicaments where you must learn to survive?  Well they are already that  but can they you learn to thrive in real life?


TikTokTickles
TikTok is a series of short videos that are addictive. Can we harness that addiction for learning?  Can we create a series of short learning experiences that are equally addictive?  Can we gamify the learning experience so that you want to learn more and more?

Happy Meals for Learning
With every Happy Meal there is a gift you can collect. Is it possible to create a happy meal where he gist isa mental model, a concept, a skill that you can collect and use to build your own learning experience?

Summer Camp
Summer camp is an experience that resonatesfoe decades. Its a magic time away from home, with new people your age, doing new things, learning new skills. At he same time for the counselors and instructors it's an entirely crafted teaching experience. Can we reimagine summer camp as a learning experience that resonates for decades?

A challenge
AI can be used to create views of almost any imaginary or realistic, believable or fantasy vision humans may imagine. What will AI be doing next year?

The impossible challenge?
What is our job as humans? To challenge AI to be as complex as possible, "To strive where no human has ever strived before", to entertain us, to teach us, to nurture us, to help us develop as humans. Will AI be up to the task is a good question.
