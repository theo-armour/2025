# 2026-01-06 - _Savon de Marseille_

![]()
It's time to retire my bar of soap. After many years of faithful service, my trusty bar of _Savon de Marseille_ has finally been worn down to a nub. This soap, made in the traditional way in the south of France[1], has been my go-to hand-washing soap bar for over three years.

## Cleansing Fascinations

My fascination with soap in general goes back to my early childhood.[2] My fascination with _Savon de Marseille_ certainly goes back to the mid-1970s. On May 29, 1976, _The Economist_ magazine published an article in the Business Brief section titled "The Beauty Business." The article reported that the French consumed significantly less soap and deodorant than their neighbors—roughly half the amount of soap per capita compared to the British.

The article generated several humorous letters to the editor, including suggestions that low soap use explained why the French consumed more perfume than the British or that they used more bidets than baths. And there happened to be a letter from a reader named Theo Armour from London[3]. He wrote that the French's lower soap consumption was due to their preference for traditional soap bars such as _Savon de Marseille_. These traditional soapslast longer and are more economical than liquid soaps or deodorants. BTW, I am forever grateful and honored to have been published in _The Economist_ magazine!

What I cannot remember is where this specific knowledge of the durability of _Savon de Marseille_ came from. This was well before my marriage to Isabelle, and I had not had many contacts with life in France up to that point, though I had lived across the Channel in England since 1971. But I did have several brief visits to the South of France to visit my father and stepmother in St. Paul-de-Vence and to attend my sister Allison's wedding there. I assume it must have been during that time when I gained this hugely valuable piece of life advice.

Nonetheless, the durability was confirmed after my then-wife-to-be Isabelle and I met, and I went to her family's farm, _La Ferme de la Montagne_, in northern France. In the wash basin outside the ground-floor toilet, there was always a large bar of _Savon de Marseille_ for hand washing. It was there in 1981; it was there in 1991, even with frequent use by the entire family and guests. You had to rub and rub to get anything out of it, but nonetheless your hands came out squeaky clean, wash after wash.

## The Prodigal Soap Returns

More recently, after years of relying on soap coming out of a bottle, I felt the call to return to my roots and try _Savon de Marseille_ again. Isabelle kindly bought me a bar of the real thing from a shop in Paris.

The soap in the photo above was given to me by Isabelle several years ago as a Christmas present. I started using it perhaps in 2022.

As you can see, it is still quite large. You can still discern the "72%" stamp on the soap and the color is still definitely green. These two signs are the classic evidence that the soap is genuine, made from genuine olive oil. The issue is that after three years its composition has been altered, and it now feels almost like a block of wax. With use, the olive oil has been soaked out.

## The Art of Soap Preservation

Well, it turns out that there are techniques for the successful use of _Savon de Marseille_. If you use _Savon de Marseille_ just like any other soap—when you wash your hands and just put it on the side of the wash basin—the bottom stays wet. And the wet soap melts away almost instantly into a puddle of mush. Not good.

The trick is to let the soap dry out extremely well between washes. It must not sit in a wet soap dish. It must be elevated so that air gets around all its surfaces. So, in a sense, water is the enemy of _Savon de Marseille_. The sooner it gets the dirt off your fingers and goes back to being warm and dry, the happier it is![4]

As you can see, I eventually purchased a plastic soap saver where the soap sits on raised plastic prongs. This helps. The other thing that I do is alternate which side is facing up when I put the bar back on the soap saver.

## Bars Two and Three: A Legacy Plan

The original gift from Isabelle contained three bars of soap. As you can see, I will now start using bar number two. With my lessons learned from the first bar, I assume that the second bar will last a lifetime (mine) and I will be able to leave the third bar as part of my legacy.[5]

***

[1] _Savon de Marseille_ is traditionally made from vegetable oils, primarily olive oil, and is known for its gentle cleansing properties. It has been produced in the Marseille region of France for over 600 years and is often associated with natural and eco-friendly skincare.

[2] When we lived in Paris in the early 1950s, my sister, my nanny, and I would listen to a radio program titled "La Famille Duraton" (but I always think of it as "La Famille du Raton" (The Raccoon Family)). "[La Famille Duraton](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Famille_Duraton)" was heavily sponsored by Palmolive soap, and the ads were often read or performed by the show's producer and actor, Jean-Jacques Vital.

The Palmolive soap talked about in the ads was not at all a _Savon de Marseille_ but a typical modern commercial soap product. If I remember correctly, even though we were quite a traditional kind of household, from time to time — at my sister's and my urging — we would have a bar of the green Palmolive for our baths. But they never lasted very long.

[3] While I can find the article, I cannot find the letters to the editor section because they apparently have not been digitized yet. So, I will need to go to a library that has paper copies or reprints of _The Economist_ from the 1970s in order to find a copy of my letter.

[4] The downside to this durability is that it is not likely that I will ever be able to test the durability of another soap that I have developed an unfulfilled craving for, which is soap from Aleppo in Syria. I believe I learned about Aleppo soap when I was reading about Agatha Christie's furtive trip to Aleppo in the 1930s.

[5] There may be another side to all of this. The bar of soap at Isabelle's family's house was white. It was the _Savon de Marseille_ made with palm oil, not olive oil. Also, it was shaped like an olive or an American football. This may mean that any water slid off of it much more easily than from the flat tops and bottoms of the olive oil-based soap bars.
