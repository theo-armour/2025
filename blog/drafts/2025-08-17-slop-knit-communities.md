## Should Strong Gods Bet On GDP?

Slightly contra Fukuyama on liberal communities

From ChatGPT summary

>Scott builds on Francis Fukuyama’s reference to R. R. Reno’s concept of “strong Gods”— populism, nationalism, religion — as foundational sources of meaning and cohesion in earlier eras. Liberals, Reno argues, sought to weaken these forces, but Fukuyama suggests liberalism need not—and should not—be hostile to community formation. Instead, a liberal society should serve as a platform upon which a variety of vibrant, value-driven communities can form. Individuals must have the freedom to create or join these communities without the tyranny of a single shared ideology.

Scott Alexander's post

>On a theoretical level, this is a great answer. On a practical level - is it really working? Are we really a nation dotted with tight-knit communities of strong values? The average person has a church they don’t attend and a political philosophy that mainly cashes out in Twitter dunks. Otherwise they just consume whatever slop the current year’s version of capitalism chooses to throw at them.

>It’s worth surveying the exceptions that prove the rule:

>The Amish: They live apart in tight-knit communities with strong countercultural values, and carefully control their technological and ideological environment. 10/10.

>Cults and communes: Any cult mature enough to have its own compound, or any communal living project, has succeeded almost as thoroughly as the Amish. We may not support their insane religious beliefs, or the various sex crimes they are no doubt committing, but they have succeeded at Fukuyama’s suggestion of knitting themselves a new god within the liberal order. 9.5/10.

>Ultra-Orthodox Jews and Mormons: Get lots of people of the same religion together in one place - a timeless classic. Some of the ultra-est of the ultra-Orthodox are still more fluent in Yiddish than English, giving them near-invincibility from the mainstream. 9/10.

>The Free State Project: some libertarians made a deal that if enough other libertarians agreed, they would all move to New Hampshire and try to turn it into a libertarian paradise. They got about 20,000 people on board; the results ranged from building entirely new libertarian towns in the forest, to buying homes in Portsmouth or Manchester and keeping in touch with their libertarian friends. 7/10.

>Serious Christianity: Lots of Christians have social circles centered around their church, send their children to Christian schools, have Christian therapists they can visit if they feel down, and consume Christian media. On the other hand, they usually work a secular job, and most of their neighbors are secular. 6/10.

>The LGBTQ community: don’t laugh at this one. If you know many of these people, you know they have their own parallel society of LGBT friends, LGBT bars, and LGBT dating sites. They attend LGBT parties, conform to LGBT fashions, and watch LGBT sports (like roller derby). They live in special LGBT-friendly neighborhoods, and everyone around them follows LGBT-friendly norms. They even have their own flag, an obvious first step for people trying to form a country-within-a-country. 5/10.

>The rationalists: I live on a street with five other rationalist families and a small rationalist microschool. The broader Bay Area rationalist community has its own parties, dating sites, media, holidays, a conference center, and even a choir. 5/10

>But even defining these exceptions broadly, probably fewer than 10% of Americans belong to one of them.

Over 30% of Americans are 25 or under. The great majority of them under the auspices of some kind of community.

Data from 2020 indicates that nearly 24 million people, a little over 15% of the workforce, are involved in military, public, and national service at the local, state and federal levels

Perhaps 5% of americans over 55 live in age-oriented communities


There are many communities where middle managers and professionals associate with people in similar careers inside and outside of work. They attain the same conventions, they do the same continuing education, and they send their children to the same schools.

There are an amazing number of associations.There's the Association of Call Centers.There's the Association of Family Officers.

There are still garden clubs and kennel clubs and bridge clubs and more, but increasingly it seems to me that people increasingly keep up with professional organizations.

and then there are all the organizations that help Tiger Balm, such as PTAs and volleyball groups and swimming clubs for the kids.

It seems to me that rather than having tight-knie communities, we are swamped with multiples of loose-knit communities. One can be a member of social networks, cosplay, office, sports teams, alumni associations, music groups, and so on. Slop-knit communities if you wish
