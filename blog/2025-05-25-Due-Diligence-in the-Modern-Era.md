# 2025-05-25 Due Diligence in the Modern Era

_I got distracted and this post never was completed â€”of tidied or mage coherent._

_Nonetheless, I am leaving it here as a record of my thoughts at the time. My failures are just as instructive as my successes. ;-)_

## Recapitulation

This post is a continuation of several previous posts. 

The task at hand is to somehow create a due diligence framework for a mergers and acquisition prospect. 


## Intro

Given my background and history of methods of working, I kind of feel that doing due diligence will be a way that I can be helpful to the startups at Founders Inc. 

But it will require a change of perspective from the methods I used in the past. 

In the past, it was about crap detection and finding fault and possible points of failure. This was because I was often protecting the money, helping VCs not make a mistake, acting as a gamekeeper. 

In the future, I must use due diligence to be able to find even more opportunities for the startup to succeed, To help the startup identify possible benefits to existing industries and processes and to be able to identify targets and metrics that will help them achieve their goals. 

## 10:56 Introduction

It would be nice to include the time of day with each of these snippets of writing. Helps prove that it was done by a human. Also, I will put some indications that something was written by AI. If it's in the middle of a sentence, it might be something like this: [ai:].

I'm going to take a break from writing this for a while and do some other work. But the next steps will be to use AI to see if I can come up with a due diligence  checklist. First, I will search for any existing due diligence checklists from an authoritative source using AI. And then I will use AI to help ameliorate whatever I find. 

In all of these, I will try and include my prompt, the AI engine I used, and the engine's response.
