I tried running Python in the Ming 64 terminal on. The S code. Period. It did not run because that environment is expecting Linux or something like that. Period. So it turns out that if I want to run Python easily, I should use the Windows command prompt. That made me think, should I be writing this in Linux or should I be writing this in Windows period? Well, given that my environment is mostly Windows, I better keep my Python in Windows as well and therefore use the command prompt as the default PS code terminal. So that will make my life simpler and and easier to keep get coding, much as I like the idea of being an expert. Or better not. Maybe not an expert, but better in Linux. Eventually.
